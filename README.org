#+title: Wordel: [[https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/][Wordle]] (aka Lingo) in Emacs

[[./demo.gif]]

For the uninitiated, this is a process of elimination word game.
You guess a word and each letter of your word will be color coded to reveal how it relates to the hidden word.

* Install

** With straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical t
(straight-use-package '(wordel :host github :repo "progfolio/wordel" :files (:defaults "words")))
#+end_src

** Manually
- Clone this repo into your load-path
- =(require 'wordel)=
- =M-x wordel=

* Playing
There are two main modes of game play.
To play a regular game, =M-x wordel=.
To play a marathon (a series of puzzles which increase in difficulty), enable =wordel-marathon-mode=.

* Evil users
See [[https://www.github.com/progfolio/wordel/issues/1][this issue]].

* Notice:

I wrote this for fun over the past couple of days.
Expect bugs.
