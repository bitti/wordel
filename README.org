#+title: Wordel: [[https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/][Wordle]] (aka Lingo) in Emacs

[[./demo.gif]]

For the uninitiated, this is a process of elimination word game.
You guess a word and each letter of your word will be color coded to reveal how it relates to the hidden word.

* Install

** With [[https://www.github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical t
(straight-use-package '(wordel :host github :repo "progfolio/wordel" :files (:defaults "words")))
#+end_src

** Manually
- Clone this repo into your load-path
- =(require 'wordel)=
- =M-x wordel= or =M-x wordel-marathon=

* Evil users
You'll want to be in insert mode for wordel's modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical t
(evil-make-intercept-map wordel-mode-map)
(evil-make-intercept-map wordel-select-mode-map)
(evil-set-initial-state  'wordel-mode 'insert)
(evil-set-initial-state  'wordel-select-mode 'insert))
#+end_src
